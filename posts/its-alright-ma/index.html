<main>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Bob Dylan, though I wouldn&rsquo;t be brave enough to say I<br />
know all his songs or even most of them. He&rsquo;s written more songs than<br />
I&rsquo;ve had hot meals (a faint memory of my father reading from a<br />
magazine on a camping trip).</p>

<p>Still, I&rsquo;ll contend his epic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYajHZ4QUVM">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Alright Ma (I&rsquo;m Only Bleeding)&rdquo;</a> is<br />
far and away his best work (((if you&rsquo;re measuring on a usual poetic<br />
meter))). The dense metaphor and rapid, nesting rhymes thread through<br />
from beginning to end. The structure is just so damn thick and the<br />
rhythm so pressing it&rsquo;s hard to peel apart as you listen but the<br />
entire time there is this impression of an oncoming prophesied<br />
doom. This world is coming apart at the seams and no one&rsquo;s really<br />
watching, only concerned with their social clubs, rat races, and the<br />
rules of their masters.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Alright Ma has 675 words across 104 lines. Five sets of three<br />
verses, each set punctuated by a short chorus/refrain where the<br />
speaker pleads his mother not to worry so &ndash; it&rsquo;s only life after all.<br />
Each verse has four or five lines which rhyme with each other, while<br />
the verse is punctuated with a line rhyming with the other verses in<br />
the set including the chorus&rsquo;s final line. That is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">BBBBB-A CCCCC-A DDDDD-A EE-A \\
</code></pre>

<p>The common rhyme imbues a sense of continuity, while the persistent<br />
repetition of the rhyme within the verse makes it feel like it&rsquo;s<br />
rushing by &ndash; like street-lights passed on a quiet night, similar but<br />
still changing. You look back thinking you&rsquo;ll be just where you were<br />
but before you know it you find yourself at the end of the<br />
seven-minute song and you&rsquo;ve traveled through the varying struggles<br />
Dylan saw in the 1960&rsquo;s, which yet prove to be timeless in my eyes.</p>

<p>Without further ado, the lyrical analysis</p>

<p>Darkness at the break of noon<br /><br />
Shadows even the silver spoon<br /><br />
The handmade blade, the child&rsquo;s balloon<br /><br />
Eclipses both the sun and moon<br /><br />
To understand you know too soon<br /><br />
There is no sense in trying<br /><br />
<br /></p>

<p>As pointed threats, they bluff with scorn<br /><br />
Suicide remarks are torn<br /><br />
From the fool&rsquo;s gold mouthpiece the hollow horn<br /><br />
Plays wasted words, proves to warn<br /><br />
That he not busy being born is busy dying<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Temptation&rsquo;s page flies out the door<br /><br />
You follow, find yourself at war<br /><br />
Watch waterfalls of pity roar<br /><br />
You feel to moan but unlike before<br /><br />
You discover that you&rsquo;d just be one more<br /><br />
Person crying<br /><br />
<br /><br />
So don&rsquo;t fear if you hear<br /><br />
A foreign sound to your ear<br /><br />
It&rsquo;s alright, Ma, I&rsquo;m only sighing<br /><br />
<br /><br />
As some warn victory, some downfall<br /><br />
Private reasons great or small<br /><br />
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call<br /><br />
To make all that should be killed to crawl<br /><br />
While others say don&rsquo;t hate nothing at all<br /><br />
Except hatred<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Disillusioned words like bullets bark<br /><br />
As human gods aim for their mark<br /><br />
Make everything from toy guns that spark<br /><br />
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark<br /><br />
It&rsquo;s easy to see without looking too far<br /><br />
That not much is really sacred<br /><br />
<br /><br />
While preachers preach of evil fates<br /><br />
Teachers teach that knowledge waits<br /><br />
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates<br /><br />
Goodness hides behind its gates<br /><br />
But even the president of the United States<br /><br />
Sometimes must have to stand naked<br /><br />
<br /><br />
An&rsquo; though the rules of the road have been lodged<br /><br />
It&rsquo;s only people&rsquo;s games that you&rsquo;ve got to dodge<br /><br />
And it&rsquo;s alright, Ma, I can make it<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Advertising signs they con<br /><br />
You into thinking you&rsquo;re the one<br /><br />
That can do what&rsquo;s never been done<br /><br />
That can win what&rsquo;s never been won<br /><br />
Meantime life outside goes on<br /><br />
All around you<br /><br />
<br /><br />
You lose yourself, you reappear<br /><br />
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear<br /><br />
Alone you stand with nobody near<br /><br />
When a trembling distant voice, unclear<br /><br />
Startles your sleeping ears to hear<br /><br />
That somebody thinks they really found you<br /><br />
<br /><br />
A question in your eyes is lit<br /><br />
Yet you know there is no answer fit<br /><br />
To satisfy, insure you not to quit<br /><br />
To keep it in your mind and not forget<br /><br />
That it is not he or she or them or it<br /><br />
That you belong to<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Although the masters make the rules<br /><br />
For the wise men and the fools<br /><br />
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For them that must bow down to authority<br /><br />
That they do not respect in any degree<br /><br />
Who despise their jobs, their destinies<br /><br />
Speak jealously of them that are free<br /><br />
Cultivate their flowers to be<br /><br />
Nothing more than something they invest in<br /><br />
<br /><br />
While some on principles baptized<br /><br />
To strict party platform ties<br /><br />
Social clubs in drag disguise<br /><br />
Outsiders they can freely criticize<br /><br />
Tell nothing except who to idolize<br /><br />
And then say God bless him<br /><br />
<br /><br />
While one who sings with his tongue on fire<br /><br />
Gargles in the rat race choir<br /><br />
Bent out of shape from society&rsquo;s pliers<br /><br />
Cares not to come up any higher<br /><br />
But rather get you down in the hole<br /><br />
That he&rsquo;s in<br /><br />
<br /><br />
But I mean no harm nor put fault<br /><br />
On anyone living in a vault<br /><br />
But it&rsquo;s alright, Ma, if I can&rsquo;t please him<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Old lady judges watch people in pairs<br /><br />
Limited in sex, they dare<br /><br />
To tell fake morals, insult and stare<br /><br />
While money doesn&rsquo;t talk, it swears<br /><br />
Obscenity, who really cares<br /><br />
Propaganda, all is phony<br /><br />
<br /><br />
While them that defend what they cannot see<br /><br />
With a killer&rsquo;s pride, security<br /><br />
It blows the minds most bitterly<br /><br />
For them that think death&rsquo;s honesty<br /><br />
Won&rsquo;t fall upon them naturally<br /><br />
Life sometimes must get lonely<br /><br />
<br /><br />
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed<br /><br />
Graveyards, false goals (gods), I scuff<br /><br />
At pettiness which plays so rough<br /><br />
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs<br /><br />
Kick my legs to crash it off<br /><br />
Say okay, I have had enough, what else can you show me?<br /><br />
<br /><br />
And if my thought-dreams could be seen<br /><br />
They&rsquo;d probably put my head in a guillotine<br /><br />
But it&rsquo;s alright, Ma, it&rsquo;s life, and life only<br /></p>
