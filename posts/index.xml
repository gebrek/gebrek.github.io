      <description>sat he, dreamless
ambition free, fearless
from a couch in the city
no one to impress
his days whittle away
under hazy smoke sway
inevitably underdress&amp;rsquo;d
distressed depressed test-less

into the cracks in the window-sill seams
carrying the mem&amp;rsquo;ry of a dream</description>

wherein I should find some inspiration for papers to read and report</description>

      <description>*Well not really the beginning
This is a post overdue, to a blog I should have started a while ago,
if not to achieve anything other than a &amp;ldquo;I could so I did&amp;rdquo;
thing. After multiple failed attempts using blogger, wordpress, et
al. I stopped because I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like the workflow.&amp;nbsp;1
So I&amp;rsquo;m not one to bear the burden of a over-heavy work-flow, if it
