      <description>Honey in my mind Her sweet words were kind Summer suns setting on our love&#39;s begetting The time was too short to learn the ways of her heart
but for the Septembers spent with arms bent
around her shoulder on splintering bench
in trees turning color, cold creeping closer
October already over and now you&#39;re her lover
and you&#39;ll love her, &#39;til November
On whim of bless&#39;d sun bring green fields through seasons run</description>

      <description>Forgive the little motions which make subtle ripples rise that coalesce and grow to waves, to tides, to fearsome walls of water It is nothing like that now just a simple sound praying and pleading as though the ocean hears Indifferent though, breaking against deaf ears taking off the solitude of years  </description>

This is a post overdue, to a blog I should have started a while ago,
if not to achieve anything other than a &amp;ldquo;I could so I did&amp;rdquo;
thing. After multiple failed attempts using blogger, wordpress, et
al. I stopped because I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like the workflow.&amp;nbsp;1
So I&amp;rsquo;m not one to bear the burden of a over-heavy work-flow, if it
